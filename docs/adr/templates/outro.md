This index will continue to grow as new ADRs are written and older ones are superseded.

Decisions marked as Superseded remain here for historical traceability but should not be followed for new work. Instead, always refer to the most recent applicable ADR.

For contributors and maintainers:

* If you are making a significant architectural change, create a new ADR and link it here rather than editing old ones.
* If an ADR no longer reflects reality, mark it as Superseded and reference the new decision.
* If you are new to the project, reviewing this index is the best way to understand the why behind the system’s current design.

By maintaining this record, we ensure our architecture decisions remain transparent, traceable, and helpful for both today’s developers and tomorrow’s maintainers.
