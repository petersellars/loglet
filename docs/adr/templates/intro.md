This document is the index of all Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for this project.

ADRs capture the significant architectural and technical decisions we’ve made, along with the context and reasoning behind them. They provide a shared memory for the team, so we don’t lose knowledge when people move on or when decisions fade from day-to-day discussion.

For developers, the ADRs explain why the system is built the way it is and help avoid re-debating past decisions.

For new maintainers, the ADRs serve as a guide to the project’s evolution: what choices were made, what alternatives were considered, and what trade-offs shaped the current architecture. This makes it easier to onboard quickly, contribute effectively, and understand where changes may have wider impact.

The list below contains all ADRs, in the order they were introduced.
