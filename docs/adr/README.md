# Architecture Decision Records

This document is the index of all Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for this project.

ADRs capture the significant architectural and technical decisions we’ve made, along with the context and reasoning behind them. They provide a shared memory for the team, so we don’t lose knowledge when people move on or when decisions fade from day-to-day discussion.

For developers, the ADRs explain why the system is built the way it is and help avoid re-debating past decisions.

For new maintainers, the ADRs serve as a guide to the project’s evolution: what choices were made, what alternatives were considered, and what trade-offs shaped the current architecture. This makes it easier to onboard quickly, contribute effectively, and understand where changes may have wider impact.

The list below contains all ADRs, in the order they were introduced.

* [1. Record architecture decisions](0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)

This index will continue to grow as new ADRs are written and older ones are superseded.

Decisions marked as Superseded remain here for historical traceability but should not be followed for new work. Instead, always refer to the most recent applicable ADR.

For contributors and maintainers:

* If you are making a significant architectural change, create a new ADR and link it here rather than editing old ones.
* If an ADR no longer reflects reality, mark it as Superseded and reference the new decision.
* If you are new to the project, reviewing this index is the best way to understand the why behind the system’s current design.

By maintaining this record, we ensure our architecture decisions remain transparent, traceable, and helpful for both today’s developers and tomorrow’s maintainers.
